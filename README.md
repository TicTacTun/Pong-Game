# Pong-Game
This is a very simple pong game using pygame module. I have taken help from this particular YouTube channel and modify the code a little bit

Pong is a classic arcade game that was first released in 1972. It was one of the earliest video games and helped establish the video game industry. The game is a two-player game in which each player controls a paddle that moves vertically on the screen, and the objective is to hit a ball back and forth between the paddles without missing it. The game continues until one player misses the ball, and the other player scores a point.
In my code, I use this as a singleplayer mode which means, the opponent paddle has it's own AI movement.
